/**
 * A proportional-integral controller (PI) with output limitation and output
 * limit feedback. The integral part of the controller will be limited to not
 * run away when the output value is at its limit. This has two effects: The
 * controller won't need time to get back to its operation point after any
 * potential overshoot over the output limitation. On the other hand, the
 * limited integral might result in a behavior of the controller raising the
 * output value even if the input is still negative if the input is rising
 * faster than the hold down integral part is still being pushed down by the
 * integral. To prevent such a behavior, a value controlling controller can be
 * set to an output limit value of -5 to let the controller run negative on
 * purpose.

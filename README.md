# PhxNetModExt - Control Systems extension

An extension of the PhxNetMod project containing classes for automation of 
modeling objects (like switchable pumps) and some very basic control systems
classes.

This was set up as a separate project to keep the main PhxNetMod project clean
and reduce dependencies.

**Please note: This is work in process. It's probably not good code and only
published to have easy access to it and disclose source code of my projects
for security reasons.** I strongly believe that being able to disclose the 
full source and allow people to compile and build projects themselves is
a proper way to prove that an application does not pose any risks.

Those classes are designed to be used in the chornobyl RBMK simulator project.
